##Question 1:
###You are assisting a Red Hat Partner with building a solution for their Python-based web application. The web application uses Django for the front-end UI and MySQL for the backend database. The application is currently hosted on virtual machines but they are interested in migrating to containers.

###You have been instructed to assist the Partner with understanding the advantages (and disadvantages) of containers compared to their current virtual machine solution. They also want you to present a demo of this containerized solution with a sample web application using both Django and MySQL. The web application can be extremely basic and is used for a simple demo of the containerized web application.

Consider the following:
* What will the container build files for the front-end and back-end images look like? Provide an example of each.
* How would we ensure the containers run as non-root users? Why is that important?
* How do we ensure the customerâ€™s data is persistent, backed-up, and restored? Why is that important?
* What does networking look like in this scenario?
* How does communication occur between the front and backend services?
* Will the customer need to make any adjustments to firewall rules?
* Where will the container images reside and how will the containers access images in a private repository?
* How can we handle single-points of failure in a containerized environment? Are there any existing tools or software that can help with this?
